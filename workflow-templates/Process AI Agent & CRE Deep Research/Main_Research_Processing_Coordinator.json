For PropTech companies developing AI due diligence solutions, the findings would validate their value proposition and inform product development.

For academic researchers, positive findings would open up a new avenue of research on the economics of AI agents in complex markets, potentially spurring further studies on AI's impact on other aspects of real estate and finance.

Data on AI adoption in due diligence is not readily available through standard databases and will likely require primary data collection efforts (surveys, interviews, or data sharing agreements with PropTech companies or early-adopting real estate firms). The sample period should cover the recent years where AI agent adoption in CRE due diligence has begun to occur (e.g., 2018-present). Data frequency is per transaction.\\\",\\n    \\\"researchQuestions\\\": [\\n      \\\"How does the adoption of AI agent-driven due diligence quantitatively impact the time taken to close commercial real estate transactions, holding other factors constant?\\\",\\n      \\\"What is the effect of AI agent-driven due diligence on the deviation of the final transaction price from the initial listing price in commercial property sales?\\\",\\n      \\\"Does the use of AI agents in CRE due diligence lead to a statistically significant reduction in the incidence or severity of post-transaction disputes or unforeseen property-related issues?\\\",\\n      \\\"Are the impacts of AI agent-driven due diligence on transaction outcomes heterogeneous across different property types, deal complexities, or market conditions?\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"hypotheses\\\": [\\n      \\\"H0: The adoption of AI agent-driven due diligence has no significant effect on reducing the time to close a CRE transaction.

HA: The impact of AI agent-driven due diligence on transaction outcomes varies significantly depending on property type, deal complexity, and prevailing market conditions.\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"noveltyContribution\\\": \\\"This research offers a significant contribution by being among the first to empirically investigate the causal impact of AI *agents* on commercial real estate transaction outcomes. Existing literature on technology in real estate primarily focuses on broader themes like online platforms (e.g., Zillow's impact on residential markets), the use of big data for valuation or market analysis, or general PropTech adoption without distinguishing between different types of AI or automation. This study specifically targets the *agentic* nature of AI systems capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks like due diligence autonomously. \\\\n\\\\nIt contributes to the Transaction Cost Economics literature by providing novel empirical evidence on how advanced AI technology can reduce specific transaction costs (information gathering, verification) in a complex market like CRE. It also contributes to the Information Economics literature by examining how AI agents can mitigate information asymmetry in real estate transactions, leading to potentially more efficient market outcomes. \\\\n\\\\nCompared to seminal works on real estate transaction costs (e.g., Clapp, 1980s) or information asymmetry (e.g., Dale, 2000s), this research introduces a new technological dimension ‚Äì AI agents ‚Äì that was not present or considered in those foundational studies. It moves beyond simply analyzing the impact of data availability to examining the impact of autonomous *processing* and *action* based on that data. The contribution is thus theoretical (extending TCE and Information Economics to the age of AI agents), empirical (providing the first evidence on this specific impact), and methodological (developing an identification strategy for a nascent technology).\\\",\\n    \\\"expectedImplications\\\": \\\"Positive findings supporting the hypotheses would have significant implications for various stakeholders. For real estate firms and investors, it would provide empirical evidence supporting the adoption of AI agent-driven due diligence to enhance efficiency, reduce risk, and potentially improve financial performance. This could accelerate the integration of AI into standard CRE workflows. For PropTech companies developing AI due diligence solutions, the findings would validate their value proposition and inform product development. For policymakers and regulators, understanding the impact of AI on transaction speed and risk could inform discussions around market efficiency, transparency, and potential new regulatory considerations related to AI in real estate. For academic researchers, positive findings would open up a new avenue of research on the economics of AI agents in complex markets, potentially spurring further studies on AI's impact on other aspects of real estate and finance. Null or negative findings would suggest limitations in current AI capabilities for complex tasks like due diligence or highlight implementation challenges, providing valuable insights for both practitioners and researchers on areas needing improvement or caution. The findings could also inform best practices for the responsible and effective integration of AI into real estate processes.\\\",\\n    \\\"relevantLink\\\": \\\"https://www.costar.com/, https://www.msci.com/real-assets, https://reonomy.com/\\\",\\n    \\\"confidenceScore\\\": 9\\n  }\\n]\\n```\"}"

              "economicMechanisms": "Information asymmetry, where one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other, is a classic problem in economics (Akerlof, 1970). In CRE, this can manifest in differences in knowledge about property condition, market values, or future prospects. AI agents can act as sophisticated information processors, aggregating and analyzing data from numerous sources (market data, property records, news, local regulations) to provide a more complete and balanced information set to all parties, thereby reducing asymmetry. This improved information flow should lead to more efficient pricing and potentially alter bargaining dynamics, consistent with information economics and market efficiency theories.",

This study contributes by empirically testing the effect of AI agent adoption on information asymmetry proxies and market efficiency in CRE. It extends the literature on information economics in real estate by considering advanced AI applications. Seminal work on information asymmetry (Akerlof, 1970) and its application in real estate provides the theoretical foundation.",

Market-level data on price volatility and trading volume as proxies for market efficiency. Potential sources include commercial real estate transaction databases, brokerage firm data (if accessible), and surveys of market participants. Data frequency would be per transaction and potentially market-level time series data.",
              "baselineEmpiricalDesign": "Examine transactions where at least one party is known to use AI agents for information gathering and analysis, comparing outcomes to similar transactions without AI agent involvement. Use regression analysis with dependent variables such as bid-ask spread, time on market, and price deviation from initial listing. Control variables would include property characteristics, market conditions, and characteristics of the transacting parties. Instrumental variables could be explored if a suitable instrument for AI agent adoption can be identified. Analyze market-level efficiency metrics (e.g., price volatility, autocorrelation of returns) in markets with higher vs. lower AI agent adoption rates. Robustness checks could include alternative measures of information asymmetry and market efficiency, and subsample analysis based on party type (buyer vs. seller side AI usage).",
